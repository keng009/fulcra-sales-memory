# Sales Memory

The domain language of this skill packet: two Claude skills that turn a founder's own Fulcra account into customer-relationship memory for their sales pipeline. This glossary is the canonical vocabulary; `skills/sales-memory/references/conventions.md` holds the data formats behind it.

## Language

### The interactions

**Touchpoint**:
A real-world interaction between the user and a person in their pipeline — a call, meeting, email exchange, event conversation, or similar. The event itself, not any stored copy of it.
_Avoid_: interaction, meeting note, log entry (for the event)

**Representation**:
A stored projection of one touchpoint. A touchpoint has up to three: a relationship-file **entry**, a **typed record**, and (when CRM sync is on) a CRM **note**. One event, up to three projections, all carrying the same dedupe key.

**Entry**:
The narrative representation of a touchpoint: a dated block inside a relationship file, newest first.

**Typed record**:
The structured representation of a touchpoint: one Sales Touchpoint record, queryable by date, powering reports and stale alerts.
_Avoid_: structured record, annotation

**Sales Touchpoint**:
The custom Fulcra data type (proper noun) whose records are the typed records.

**Channel**:
How a touchpoint happened. Exactly one of: call, meeting, email, event, message, other.

### The people

**Relationship**:
The user's ongoing connection to one person — always person-level. Company-level views ("what do I know about Brightpath?") are always derived by aggregating that company's people; there are no company-level relationship files.
_Avoid_: contact (that's the CRM's word), account

**Company**:
The company a lead or customer belongs to — the account (payload key: `company`). The unit reporting groups by; "account" is the reporting word ("Accounts engaged").
_Avoid_: firm

**Relationship file**:
The one narrative file per person under `/sales/relationships/<slug>.md`: who they are, open follow-ups, and their touchpoint entries.

**Person slug**:
The lowercase, hyphenated identifier derived from a person's name (`jordan-lee`), disambiguated by company only on collision.

**Sample touchpoint**:
The clearly-labeled fictional touchpoint (Jordan Lee, Brightpath Software) the demo offers when the user has nothing real to log. Never presented as real data.

### The machinery

**Dedupe key**:
The deterministic identifier every touchpoint gets (`touch:<person-slug>:<YYYY-MM-DD>`, ordinal-suffixed `-2`, `-3` for additional same-day touchpoints, or the transcript id). Each representation is scanned for it in its own store before writing; a match means confirm-with-the-user (same conversation → skip; different → next ordinal), never silent assumption. The mechanism behind "re-running can't duplicate data."

**Provenance suffix**:
The trailer every representation carries: producer | evidence | recorded-at. Marks stored conclusions as derived, never as source observations.

**Dual write**:
Writing a captured touchpoint as both its entry and its typed record in one pass.

**Bootstrap**:
What either skill does at the start of a fresh session: inspect the Fulcra data catalog and the `/sales/` folder, detect connected sources, and state what it found before acting.

**Capture / Recall / Report**:
The full skill's three behaviors: log a touchpoint; brief the user on a person ("prep me for X"); summarize a period ("what moved this week"), including the going-cold list.

**Going cold**:
The state of a relationship whose latest touchpoint is 45+ days old; surfaced by Report.
_Avoid_: stale (in user-facing output; fine internally)

**Stage noted**:
An optional, as-of-that-conversation observation of where a deal stands, captured only when the user volunteers it. Narrative, never managed pipeline state — the user's CRM owns pipeline (ADR-0004).
_Avoid_: stage (bare, implying managed state), pipeline stage

**Source level**:
How much automation the full skill detected: Level 1 (Fulcra only, conversational capture), Level 2 (+ calendar), Level 3 (+ transcript tool). Detected at bootstrap, never required.

**CRM sync**:
The optional, detected, one-way copy of touchpoints into the user's CRM as notes on matched contacts. Orthogonal to source levels; never touches fields or stages, and creates a contact only through the gated ADR-0008 flow (off by default, confirmed per contact).

### The flow

**Snapshot**:
The read-only analysis of the user's recent sales activity (default 30 days), generated from connected sources and shown before anything is stored. Performs zero writes by definition.
_Avoid_: report (that's the stored-memory review), audit

**Commit**:
Converting a snapshot (or deeper backfill) into stored memory on one collective yes (ADR-0005). High-confidence drafts are written; ambiguity is parked, never guessed.
_Avoid_: sync (that's the CRM copy). "Import" is reserved for individual CRM-note-origin touchpoints, never the flow as a whole.

**Backfill**:
Committing touchpoints from past activity (calendar, transcripts, CRM notes) rather than logging them live. Activity-bounded, never CRM-bounded (ADR-0006); backfilled entries never create open follow-ups.

**Review queue**:
`/sales/review-queue.md` — where ambiguous commit items wait for the user's ruling, each with its evidence. Parked items exist nowhere else until ruled on.

**Account history check**:
The "talked to this company before?" lookup when a new lead appears: direct hits, the user's own past judgment, labeled inferences, and a read-only CRM presence check. A read; never writes.

**Tend**:
The ongoing mode after commit: small deltas offered in one line (including the opt-in scheduled sweep, cursored by watermarks), vetoes honored immediately, the review queue surfaced occasionally — seconds per day, never a project.

**Veto**:
The user striking a stored touchpoint ("that one's wrong"). The file entry is removed (versioned edit); because typed records have no per-record delete, the dedupe key goes on `handoff.md`'s `## Vetoed keys` list — the tombstone every read these skills perform excludes and no commit re-imports (readers outside the skills must apply the list themselves).

**Commit ledger**:
The itemized list shown immediately before the one collective yes — one line per draft (person, date, source, one-line gist), split into Will save and Parked for review. What makes ADR-0005's "read exactly what will be saved" literal.

**Pipeline**:
For sellers with more than one business: a registered name in `handoff.md`'s `## Pipelines` list that a relationship belongs to (`Pipeline:` line; `pipeline` payload field). Reports and going-cold group by it. Single-business users never see it.
_Avoid_: workstream, venture (in user-facing output)

**Auto-log**:
The standing, revocable yes for unattended sweeps (ADR-0009): a `- auto-log[<pipeline>]: <sources>` line under `## Preferences`. With it, a sweep commits only high-confidence items and parks the rest; without it, the sweep digests and asks. Turned on by "auto-log my calls", off by "stop auto-logging".

**Sweep log**:
The per-run receipt list in `handoff.md` (`## Sweep log`): one line per sweep — start time, sources, committed / parked / skipped-duplicate counts, failures. Newest 30 kept; older lines move to `sweep-log-archive.md`.

**crm-setup**:
The packet's third skill: connect a CRM (or set one up), inspect it, give it a lean pipeline whose stages mirror this skill's vocabulary, record the stage map, hand off to sync. Structure only — never contacts, deals, or notes.

**Sweep watermark**:
The per-source cursor in `handoff.md` (`## Sweep watermarks`) that a scheduled sweep reads and advances — only after its digest is fully resolved — so repeated sweeps never rediscover the same messages.

### The packet

**The demo**:
The `sales-demo` skill: one guided session, about ten minutes, ending with a prep brief from what it just stored.
_Avoid_: lite, the lite version

**The full skill**:
The `sales-memory` skill: the ongoing capture/recall/report workflow.

**Data contract**:
`skills/sales-memory/references/conventions.md` — the canonical formats both skills conform to. Where this glossary defines what a word means, the contract defines the bytes.
