# Contributing

Thanks for working on the sales packet. This file is the 60-second orientation plus the five rules that aren't obvious from the outside.

## The 60-second tour

- **Two skills, one contract.** `skills/sales-demo/` is the guided 10-minute session; `skills/sales-memory/` is the ongoing workflow. Both write the same `/sales/` layout in the user's Fulcra account, defined once in `skills/sales-memory/references/conventions.md` — the **data contract**. The demo embeds a minimal subset of it inline so it runs self-contained.
- **Vocabulary lives in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md).** Use its terms; don't drift to the synonyms it lists under _Avoid_.
- **Decisions with a "why on earth?" live in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/).** Read them before "fixing" something that looks odd — it may be deliberate (the git history and the note-title keys both are).
- **Agent tooling config** is in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and `docs/agents/` (issues live in GitHub Issues).
- These skills implement the patterns from [fulcra-for-agents](https://github.com/kubla/fulcra-for-agents): catalog inspection at bootstrap, repetition tolerance, derived context/provenance, durable handoff. Changes should stay recognizable as those patterns.

## The five rules that matter

1. **The contract is canonical, and embedded copies must not drift.** If you change a format (dedupe key, relationship-file template, payload schema, provenance suffix), change it in `conventions.md` *and* every place a skill embeds it — the demo's inline subset and the full skill's "Conventions summary" must stay byte-aligned with the contract. A drifted copy is a bug even if each file reads fine alone.

2. **Every README capability claim must map to something a skill demonstrably does.** No roadmap language presented as product, no "tested" without a real test, untested CRMs stay labeled "should work — tell us". This repo's audience is founders betting real customer relationships on it, and it reflects on Fulcra; over-claiming here costs more than anywhere else.

3. **Live platform features only.** Nothing may reference or depend on unshipped Fulcra features (at time of writing: Entries, file-system-updates, Groups). If the platform ships something new, a change may adopt it only once it's verified live.

4. **Findings that outlive a session get an issue.** A review finding fixed on the spot may live in the fixing commit's message — but anything deferred, declined-with-reasoning, or fixed across sessions gets a GitHub issue (a per-review tracking issue with a disposition table is fine, closed once every row points somewhere). Chat threads and PR comments are where findings are discussed, not where they are stored: if it only exists there, the other maintainers can't see it. Examples: the sibling repo's disposition issues, keng009/fulcra-dealflow-memory#32 and #33.

5. **A coverage claim cites the check.** Closing an issue (or writing a commit message) that claims something is "covered", "enforced", or "tested" must point at the specific thing that proves it — the `validate.mjs` anchor, the CI check, or the dated `docs/testing.md` row. No pointer, no claim; the sibling repo shipped a closed issue whose claimed validator coverage didn't exist (keng009/fulcra-dealflow-memory#21, caught by review) — same lesson applies here.

## Testing a change

First, the automated gate — it enforces rules 1 and 3 mechanically, plus Claude's skill limits (name ≤64 chars, description ≤200 chars) and link integrity. CI runs it on every push and PR:

```bash
node scripts/validate.mjs
```

Then the real test is running the thing:

1. Zip the skill folder you changed (`skills/sales-demo` or `skills/sales-memory` — the latter's `references/` must be inside the zip).
2. Upload it as a custom skill in Claude, in an account with the Fulcra connector.
3. Run the affected flow against a real Fulcra account. For write paths, run it **twice** — the second run must produce zero duplicates (the dedupe scan is a hard requirement, not an optimization).
4. If you touched the README, re-check rule 2 against what you just observed.

## Workflow

`main` is protected: changes land via PR with the `validate` check green (no approval count required — the PR is the sanity-check surface, not a gate), force-pushes and deletions are blocked. The repo admin can still push typo-grade fixes directly; everyone else PRs everything. Non-trivial changes (anything touching the contract, a skill's behavior, or a README claim) deserve a moment of the other maintainers' eyes on the PR regardless. Keep the internal spec/plan documents out of this repo — it ships product artifacts only.

## Releasing

Releases give founders ready-to-upload zips instead of clone-and-zip-yourself:

1. `node scripts/validate.mjs` is green, any live-behavior change is recorded in [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md) (dated, sanitized), and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) has the version's user-visible changes moved out of Unreleased.
2. Tag and push: `git tag v0.x.y && git push origin v0.x.y` — the release workflow validates, packages both skills with the folder at the zip root, and publishes the release with both zips attached.
3. Sanity-check the two assets install in Claude before sharing the release link.
